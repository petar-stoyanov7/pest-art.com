This is the reworked version of a rather old project of mine. I decided to 
replace the outdated PHP site with WordPress mainly out of convenience - 
rather easier to maintain and structure it. 

## Master Branch
Keep in mind that the master branch is the 'upload ready' branch. If you want 
to see the source code with unpacked styles - refer to `develop` branch.
